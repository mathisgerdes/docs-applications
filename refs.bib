  abstract = {We use machine learning to approximate Calabi-Yau and SU(3)-structure metrics, including for the first time complex structure moduli dependence. Our new methods furthermore improve existing numerical approximations in terms of accuracy and speed. Knowing these metrics has numerous applications, ranging from computations of crucial aspects of the effective field theory of string compactifications such as the canonical normalizations for Yukawa couplings, and the massive string spectrum which plays a crucial role in swampland conjectures, to mirror symmetry and the SYZ conjecture. In the case of SU(3) structure, our machine learning approach allows us to engineer metrics with certain torsion properties. Our methods are demonstrated for Calabi-Yau and SU(3)-structure manifolds based on a one-parameter family of quintic hypersurfaces in \${\textbackslash}mathbb\{P\}{\textasciicircum}4.\$},

  abstract = {We present the first version of CYJAX, a package for machine learning Calabi-Yau metrics using JAX. It is meant to be accessible both as a top-level tool and as a library of modular functions. CYJAX is currently centered around the algebraic ansatz for the K{\textbackslash}"ahler potential which automatically satisfies K{\textbackslash}"ahlerity and compatibility on patch overlaps. As of now, this implementation is limited to varieties defined by a single defining equation on one complex projective space. We comment on some planned generalizations.},

  abstract = {We propose a novel machine learning method for sampling from the high-dimensional probability distributions of Lattice Field Theories, which is based on a single neural ODE layer and incorporates the full symmetries of the problem. We test our model on the \${\textbackslash}phi{\textasciicircum}4\$ theory, showing that it systematically outperforms previously proposed flow-based methods in sampling efficiency, and the improvement is especially pronounced for larger lattices. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our model can learn a continuous family of theories at once, and the results of learning can be transferred to larger lattices. Such generalizations further accentuate the advantages of machine learning methods.},
